# Architecture

GameCapture is a screen-capture engine plus one process per plugin. The engine
owns capture, OCR, and pixel sampling; plugins own all game-semantic parsing and state. They
never share memory or a build — a plugin cannot take down capture, another plugin, or the process
that owns the screen.

```

One named pipe, one gRPC channel per plugin process, one `Track` bidi stream per channel. Every
scanned frame produces one `TickResult` per connected client — never a partial one — because all
OCR in the engine happens inside `ScanLoop`, one frame at a time
(`src/GameCapture.Engine/ScanLoop.cs:9-14`). The wire contract, handshake, and the guarantees a plugin
may rely on are the subject of [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md); this document is about the
processes and projects that contract sits between.

## Frozen constraints

These were decided once, during the original engine/plugin split, and are not up for revisiting
inside a task (the task docs that recorded the decision live under `tasks/`, which is gitignored
and not part of the repo history — the constraints below are restated in full rather than linked):

- **Windows TFM stops at the engine.** Only `GameCapture.Engine` targets
  `net10.0-windows10.0.22621.0` (`src/GameCapture.Engine/GameCapture.Engine.csproj`) — it is the only project
  that touches WGC or Windows OCR. `GameCapture.Contracts`, `GameCapture.Sdk`, `GameCapture.Sdk.Testing`, and every
  plugin target plain `net10.0`, so a plugin (or its CI) never needs a Windows OCR language pack to
  build or unit-test.
- **Per-tick atomicity.** Everything a plugin needs for one decision arrives in one `TickResult`
  read from one frame; a client's ROI set is swapped whole, never mutated mid-tick
  (`ClientConnection.cs:22-26`). No mid-tick round-trips exist in the protocol.
- **OCR-results-only boundary.** Only OCR text/geometry and small pixel buffers cross the wire.
  Raw full frames never leave the engine process — `DumpFrame` writes a PNG to disk from inside the
  engine and returns a path, it does not send bytes (`CaptureGrpcService.cs:199-237`).
- **Engine cannot be a session-0 Windows Service.** Windows Graphics Capture requires an
  interactive desktop session, so the engine is a normal per-user console exe, never a background
  service.
- **Reference ROI space is 2560x1440**, and the engine does all scaling to actual frame pixels
  server-side (`RoiScaler.cs:12-13`, `ScanLoop.ReadOneAsync` at `ScanLoop.cs:214`). Plugins declare
  ROIs once and never rescale a rect the engine reports back.
- **net10.0 (or the Windows-flavored net10.0) everywhere** — no other TFM appears in the solution.

## Component table

| Component | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protos/capture.proto` | `protos/capture.proto` | The wire contract: `CaptureEngineService` (`Track`/`ReadRoi`/`DumpFrame`/`GetStatus`) and every message shape. Governed by `buf lint` + `buf breaking` in CI (`docs/PROTOCOL.md`). |
| `GameCapture.Contracts` | `src/GameCapture.Contracts/` | Plain `net10.0` library: generated proto code, plus the pure shared types both sides use — `RoiScaler`, `WireLimits`, `OcrRegionResult`, `PixelPatchSampler`, `RoiRect`, `ProtoMapping`, `ProtocolVersion`. |
| `GameCapture.Engine` | `src/GameCapture.Engine/` | The only Windows-TFM project. WGC capture (`Core/MonitorCapture.cs`), OCR (`Core/OcrPipeline.cs`), pixel sampling (`Core/PixelSampler.cs`), hotkey hook (`Core/HotkeyListener.cs`), replay (`Core/ReplayFrameSource.cs`), the scan loop (`ScanLoop.cs`), subscription bookkeeping (`SubscriptionRegistry.cs`, `ClientConnection.cs`), status (`EngineStatus.cs`), and the gRPC surface (`Grpc/CaptureGrpcService.cs`, `Grpc/GrpcHost.cs`). Composed by `EngineHost.cs`, entered from `Program.cs`. |
| `GameCapture.Sdk` | `src/GameCapture.Sdk/` | Plain `net10.0` client library. `NamedPipeChannel`/`CaptureClient`/`TrackSession` (connection + session), `RoiSubscription`/`RoiKind`/`TickData` (declaring and reading ROIs), `ProtocolNegotiation` (handshake + version errors), and the plugin-host layer under `Plugin/` — `IGameCapturePlugin`, `GameCapturePluginHost`, `TickDispatcher`, `PluginServices`. |
| `GameCapture.Sdk.Testing` | `src/GameCapture.Sdk.Testing/` | Public testing companion package (no `InternalsVisibleTo`): `TickDataBuilder`, `FakePluginServices`, `ReplayHarness`, `EngineLocator` — spawns a real `GameCapture.Engine.exe` against a corpus and drives a plugin's real `GameCapturePluginHost` path for parity tests. |
| `MissionPlugin` | [`gamecapture-plugins`](https://github.com/PetitCastor/gamecapture-plugins) | Tracks mission-board text via `IGameCapturePlugin`. Lives in the plugins repo — a pure SDK consumer, not built here. |
| `RefineryPlugin` | [`gamecapture-plugins`](https://github.com/PetitCastor/gamecapture-plugins) | Tracks refinery work orders via `IGameCapturePlugin`; owns the order ledger. Same repo as above. |
| `tests/` | `tests/` | One test project per component that lives here. Plugin replay corpora live with the plugins, in the plugins repo (`docs/REPLAY.md`). |
