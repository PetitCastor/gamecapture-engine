/// <summary>
/// A replay corpus the test hands out one frame at a time, cycling as often as needed. The plain
/// <see cref="ReplayFrameSource"/> runs flat out by design, which makes "do X, then observe the
/// next tick" a race the test would lose most of the time: three frames fit inside the client's
/// outbound channel, so the whole corpus can be produced before the first tick is even read.
/// Gating the source turns that ordering into a fact instead of a hope.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Defaults to replay-corpus mode so the loop keeps replay's blocking backpressure — dropping a
/// tick would break the very ordering this source exists to guarantee. Pass <c>isReplay: false</c>
/// to drive the live path instead, where the loop drops rather than blocks and pushes to every
/// registered client whether or not it has subscribed; that is the only way to test behaviour a
/// plugin will only ever meet in a live session. It never reports end-of-stream, so a run ends by
/// cancellation rather than by corpus exhaustion.
