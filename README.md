# GameCapture

[![CI](https://github.com/PetitCastor/gamecapture-engine/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/PetitCastor/gamecapture-engine/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Release](https://github.com/PetitCastor/gamecapture-engine/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PetitCastor/gamecapture-engine/releases)

**Read a game's own UI and turn it into data — without reading the game.** GameCapture
captures the screen, runs OCR on the regions a plugin asks for, and hands each plugin one frame's
worth of readings at a time. Nothing touches game memory, game files, or the network: what a player
can see, a plugin can record.

A **capture engine** owns the screen, the OCR, and the hotkey. Each **plugin** is a separate process
that owns nothing but its own parsing and state. They talk over named-pipe gRPC, and only OCR
results and small pixel buffers ever cross — so a plugin cannot take down capture, cannot see
another plugin, and cannot be brought down by either.

## Scope of this repository

This repo is the **engine side** and nothing else: the capture engine, the wire contract, the plugin
SDK, and the `dotnet new gamecapture-plugin` template — everything a plugin author consumes, and
nothing game-specific.

**Plugins live in a separate repository, [`gamecapture-plugins`](https://github.com/PetitCastor/gamecapture-plugins)**
(`MissionPlugin`, `RefineryPlugin` — game-specific trackers built as pure SDK consumers). You do not
need this repo to write a plugin: install the template from nuget.org and reference the packages
below. Clone this one only to work on the engine, the protocol, or the SDK itself.

## Published artifacts

| Artifact | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`GameCapture.Sdk`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GameCapture.Sdk) | Plugin SDK: engine client, `IGameCapturePlugin`, `GameCapturePluginHost`. What a plugin references. |
| [`GameCapture.Contracts`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GameCapture.Contracts) | Generated wire-contract code plus the pure types both sides share. |
| [`GameCapture.Sdk.Testing`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GameCapture.Sdk.Testing) | Testing companion: `TickDataBuilder`, `FakePluginServices`, `ReplayHarness`, `EngineLocator`. |
| [`GameCapture.Plugin.Template`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GameCapture.Plugin.Template) | `dotnet new gamecapture-plugin` — a working plugin plus its test project. |
| [Releases](https://github.com/PetitCastor/gamecapture-engine/releases) | `GameCapture.Engine-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip`, a self-contained engine exe. |

All four packages share one version train (MinVer, off the `v*` tag): one release is one compatible
set. See [`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Writing a plugin

```powershell
dotnet new install GameCapture.Plugin.Template
dotnet new gamecapture-plugin -n MyPlugin
```

A plugin implements `IGameCapturePlugin` — a name, a set of regions, and what to do with a tick — and
hands it to `GameCapturePluginHost.RunAsync`, which owns connecting, subscribing, reconnecting,
cancellation, and the end-of-run summary. Three members is a working tracker; the full tutorial is
[`docs/PLUGIN-AUTHORING.md`](docs/PLUGIN-AUTHORING.md).

## Working on the engine

Windows 10/11 with an OCR language pack, and the .NET 10 SDK:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/PetitCastor/gamecapture-engine.git
cd gamecapture-engine
dotnet build GameCaptureEngine.slnx
dotnet run --project src/GameCapture.Engine     # owns the screen
```

The engine prints its pipe name, monitor, OCR language, and hotkey on startup. Ctrl+C ends it
cleanly. Engine and plugin must agree on the pipe name — configured in
`src/GameCapture.Engine/engine-config.json` and each plugin's `config.json`, or overridden on both
with `--pipe <name>`.

Engine flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--pipe <name>` | Overrides the configured named-pipe name. |
| `--monitor <index>` | Overrides which monitor is captured. |
| `--ocr-lang <bcp47>` | Overrides the configured OCR language. |
| `--replay <dir>` | Processes saved PNG frames instead of live monitor capture. |
| `--save-frames` | Saves a full PNG frame whenever the configured manual hotkey is pressed. |
| `--verbose` | Per-ROI logging on every scan. |

`--replay` is for deterministic corpus runs and cannot be combined with `--save-frames`.

## Documentation

| Document | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [`docs/PLUGIN-AUTHORING.md`](docs/PLUGIN-AUTHORING.md) | Writing a tracker: project setup, `IGameCapturePlugin`, ROIs and calibration, error policy, session events, testing. Start here. |
| [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Processes, projects, and the frozen constraints behind the split. |
| [`docs/ENGINE-SERVICES.md`](docs/ENGINE-SERVICES.md) | The engine's service catalog: `Track`/`ReadRoi`/`DumpFrame`/`GetStatus`, replay mode, hotkeys, every budget and constant. |
| [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md) | The wire contract: transport, handshake, version policy, coordinate spaces, tick atomicity, backpressure. |
| [`docs/REPLAY.md`](docs/REPLAY.md) | Replay corpora: layout, capturing one in-game, and running one against a plugin. |
| [`docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) | Protocol/engine/SDK version matrix, version-bump rules, release checklist. |

## Repository map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `protos/capture.proto` | The wire contract itself — every RPC and message shape. Linked into `GameCapture.Contracts` and guarded by `buf` in CI. |
| `src/GameCapture.Engine` | Captures monitor frames, runs OCR, hosts the named-pipe gRPC service. The only Windows-TFM project. |
| `src/GameCapture.Contracts` | Generated code for the contract above, plus the pure types both sides share. |
| `src/GameCapture.Sdk` | Plugin SDK: engine client, `IGameCapturePlugin`, `GameCapturePluginHost`. |
| `src/GameCapture.Sdk.Testing` | Testing companion: `TickDataBuilder`, `FakePluginServices`, `ReplayHarness`. |
| `templates/` | The `dotnet new gamecapture-plugin` template. Packed by explicit path — deliberately not in the solution, so its shipped content is never compiled as source. |
| `tests/` | One test project per `src/` component above. |

## Testing

```powershell
dotnet test GameCaptureEngine.slnx
```

Some capture-engine integration tests require a supported Windows OCR language pack; the normal
development environment uses the installed English pack.

Changes to `protos/capture.proto` are lint- and breaking-change-checked against `master` by the
`proto-guard` CI job (`buf.yaml`), and `template-guard` instantiates the template every PR and
builds and tests the result, so the shipped template content cannot rot unnoticed.
